# My Notebook
# ===========
#
# Welcome to my **not-a-notebook**!
#
# Here is a description, and some bullet points:
# - foo
# - bar
#   - foo
# - baz
#
# *Here* is a `code` **block**:
# ```python
# print("hello world")
# ```
#
# Here is a table:
# | foo | bar |
# |-----|-----|
# | 1   | 2   |
# | 3   | 4   |
#


# --- Do some imports
import os
import json


# --- Set a var
hello_abc = "Hello ABC!"

# --- Print it
print(hello_abc)

# ---
# This cell has no name, which is also fine
print("Hello world")
